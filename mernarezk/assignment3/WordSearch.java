	 * Method is divided into two parts, the first part we try all possible starting
	 * points on the grid ONLY if the current character is a prefix in our
	 * dictionary. The second part, if we have a matching prefix then we try to
	 * explore the neighbouring cells of that current character and once we find a
	 * word matching the dictionary we add it to the set of words. Also the set
	 * choice because two paths can eventually generate the same word so we need to
	 * eliminate the duplicates. Also visited array is used to enure we don't visit
	 * the same cell twice while we are exploring the neighbours of a cell.
	 * 
	 * @param grid
	 *            of chars that needs to be explored and assumed that grid is all
	 *            lower case and english letters so no checks needs to be done
	 * @param dictionary
	 *            dictionary object of words.
	 * @return a set of words that were found.
